# üéØ Main Goal of This Project

The main goal of this project is to bring together **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and a **CI/CD** pipeline to demonstrate how modern infrastructure can be built, configured, and automated from end to end ‚Äî with little to no manual intervention.

In simple terms:

Terraform builds it.
Ansible configures it.
CI/CD keeps it consistent and repeatable.  

Sounds simple, right?  
I thought the same... until I ran into all sorts of problems. üòÖ  

# üß© In Practice

Terraform creates the EC2 instance and outputs its public IP.

Ansible uses that IP to install and start httpd (Apache web server).

A CI/CD pipeline (via GitHub Actions, GitLab, or Bitbucket) automatically runs Terraform and Ansible each time new code is pushed, ensuring:

Consistency between environments.

Fast rollback when needed.

Continuous learning for how real DevOps pipelines work.

# üöÄ The Vision

By the end of this project, the goal is to have a fully automated pipeline that:

Builds cloud infrastructure on demand.

Configures it automatically.

Tests it continuously.

Documents every step ‚Äî from broken to fixed ‚Äî to show real progress and growth.

In short: this project is my lab for mastering Infrastructure as Code, Configuration Management, and Continuous Automation ‚Äî the three pillars of modern DevOps.

# üß∞ Ansible (first things first)

This project is Terraform ‚Üí EC2 ‚Üí Ansible. Since Ansible is where ‚Äúit actually works (or breaks)‚Äù, we‚Äôll start here.

ansible/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ansible.cfg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inventory # static example (INI or YAML)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ site.yml # main playbook

## Why this structure?

- **`ansible.cfg`** ‚Üí keeps CLI commands short and consistent (inventory path, SSH key, roles path, etc.).
- **`inventory`** ‚Üí defines ‚Äúwho‚Äù to manage (from Terraform output or a static host/IP).
- **`site.yml`** ‚Üí defines ‚Äúwhat‚Äù to do (install & start `httpd`, plus any bootstrap you need).

As this grows, you can add:

ansible/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ group_vars/ # vars shared by group (e.g., web)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ host_vars/ # vars for single host
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ roles/ # reusable roles (apache/, users/, etc.)

# ansible.cfg
```bash
---

## `ansible.cfg` (opinionated but beginner-friendly)

[defaults]
host_key_checking = False     # ok for labs! Enable in production
retry_files_enabled = False
inventory = inventory
roles_path = roles
collections_paths = collections

# Optional: if you add roles later
# roles_path = ./roles
```

# ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èWhy these choices?

host_key_checking = False stops first-contact prompts (nice for ephemeral EC2). Turn it back on in real environments.

interpreter_python = auto_silent helps Ansible find Python on various distros.

inventory = Path of the inventory file in your current project directory

roles_path = Path of the roles directory in your current project directory

collections_paths = Path of the roles directory in your current project directory

inventory
Leave your inventory file empty.... Why Steph?
Normally, Ansible needs to know which hosts to manage (EC2 public IPs, hostnames, etc.), and you‚Äôd list those in the inventory file like this:

[web]
ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com ansible_user=ec2-user

But in this project, the EC2 instance doesn't exist until Terraform builds it. That means you can't hardcode its IP/DNS in advance. Later in the project, you are going to have Terraform output the instance's public IP once it's created. Then you are going to plug that IP into Ansible when you run the playbook.

If you know anything about AWS though, when you stop an EC2 instance and start it back up, the public IP address changes. So keep that in mind! You'll have to change the ip address in your inventory file each time. OR, you can create an Elastic IP, which is like you leasing a static connection from AWS so you'll always have the same public ip address. Keyword though, "leasing". You are going to have to pay for that Elastic IP! Yikes! This is a simple project though so you won't need to lease anything. There are other ways to generate an inventory file using terraform collections, but I'm not doing it in this project. Ok, im done ranting! Moving along now...

# site.yml

```bash
- name: Configure Web Server
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: 
          - httpd
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable Apache service
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: true

    - name: Create web page
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        content: "DevOps Journey is coming along!"
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html 

    - name: Add content to Message of the day file
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /etc/motd
        line: |
          ********************************************
          * Hello! Welcome to {{ ansible_hostname }}.*
          * Great job on completing this project.    *
          * You are slowly but surely becoming a     *
          * DevOps engineer!                         *
          ********************************************
```
This ansible file installs httpd, starts and enables the httpd service, creates an html file with a fun message, and finally, writes to the motd file so when you log into the ec2 instance, you'll be greeted with a success message.

# ‚òÅÔ∏èTerraform Setup ‚Äî Building the Foundation
Now that our Ansible setup is ready, let‚Äôs move on to the Terraform side ‚Äî the part that actually builds the EC2 instance in AWS.

Before Terraform can talk to AWS, we need two things:

The AWS CLI (so we can authenticate and test credentials).

The Terraform binary (to build infrastructure as code).

Let‚Äôs go step by step üëá

# üß© Step 1 ‚Äî Install the AWS CLI
Terraform needs AWS credentials, and the easiest, most secure way to handle them is through the AWS CLI. I am using linux, so I googled "install awscli on linux" and came across this documentation >> [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

# üîê Step 2 ‚Äî Configure Your AWS Credentials Securely

Instead of hardcoding credentials into Terraform files like I did at first üò¨, store them safely using the AWS CLI. Run the following command:
```bash
aws configure
```
You'll be prompted for four values

```bash
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <Your Access Key>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <Your Secret Key>
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

This command stores your credentials in:

~/.aws/credentials ‚Üí your keys

~/.aws/config ‚Üí your default region and output format

Terraform automatically reads from these files ‚Äî no extra steps needed!

üí° Pro tip: Your keys are stored locally for your user account only.
If you ever rotate them, just rerun aws configure.

# üß± Step 3 ‚Äî Install Terraform
Now that AWS is set up, install terraform so you can start building infrastructure.

Download from the official Terraform site: [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)

Again, I'm using Linux so the commands to install terraform are below:

```bash
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo
sudo yum -y install terraform
```

# ‚òÅÔ∏è Step 4 ‚Äî Time to Build!

Now you‚Äôre ready to:

1. Move into your Terraform directory

```bash
cd terraform
```

## main.tf

```bash
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 6.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}


resource "aws_security_group" "allow_ports" {
  name        = "allow_ports"
  description = "Allow TLS inbound traffic and all outbound traffic"
}

resource "aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule" "allow_ssh" {
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.allow_ports.id
  cidr_ipv4         = "0.0.0.0/0"
  from_port         = var.aws_ssh_port
  ip_protocol       = "tcp"
  to_port           = var.aws_ssh_port
}

resource "aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule" "allow_http" {
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.allow_ports.id
  cidr_ipv4         = "0.0.0.0/0"
  from_port         = var.aws_http_port
  ip_protocol       = "tcp"
  to_port           = var.aws_http_port
}

resource "aws_vpc_security_group_egress_rule" "all_out" {
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.allow_ports.id
  cidr_ipv4         = "0.0.0.0/0"
  ip_protocol       = "-1"
}

resource "aws_key_pair" "my_key" {
  key_name   = "deployer-key"
  public_key = file(var.public_key)
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami                         = var.aws_ami # Amazon Linux 2
  instance_type               = var.instance_type
  key_name                    = aws_key_pair.my_key.key_name
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  vpc_security_group_ids      = [aws_security_group.allow_ports.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform-Ansible-AmazonLinux"
  }
}
```
This is a lot to explain! So I'll try my best to explain this as best as possible. 

# üß± What This Terraform File Does

```bash
This Terraform file automates the creation of a simple, secure EC2 environment in AWS:

Specifies AWS provider ‚Üí Tells Terraform to use the AWS plugin (version 6.0 or newer) and the region defined in var.aws_region.

Creates a security group (allow_ports) ‚Üí Controls network access:

Allows SSH (port from var.aws_ssh_port).

Allows HTTP (port from var.aws_http_port).

Allows all outbound traffic so the instance can reach the internet.

Creates an SSH key pair (deployer-key) ‚Üí Uses your local public key (from var.public_key) so you can securely connect to the instance.

Launches an EC2 instance (web) ‚Üí Based on the AMI and instance type you define in variables, attaches the security group, and tags it as Terraform-Ansible-AmazonLinux.

In short:

This file builds a ready-to-use EC2 instance with open SSH and HTTP access, a configured key pair for login, and all the networking rules Ansible needs to connect and configure the server.

```
# ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Automation (GitHub Actions)

Trigger: On every push to main, GitHub Actions builds infra with Terraform and then configures it with Ansible‚Äîhands-free.

What the workflow does, step by step:

Checkout code

Pulls your repo so the runner has your Terraform and Ansible files.

Write public key file

Creates ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub from SSH_PUBLIC_KEY (stored in repo Secrets).

Terraform uses this key to make an AWS key pair for the EC2 instance.

Setup Terraform

Installs the correct Terraform version on the runner.

Terraform init & apply

Uses AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY from Secrets to authenticate to AWS.

Runs terraform init and terraform apply -auto-approve.

Exports the instance‚Äôs public IP into ansible/inventory:

terraform output -raw public_ip > ../ansible/inventory


(That‚Äôs why your inventory file can be empty in git‚ÄîCI fills it in.)

Setup SSH private key

Writes ~/.ssh/deployer-key.pem from SSH_PRIVATE_KEY (also a Secret).

This is the key Ansible uses to SSH into the new EC2.

Install Ansible

Installs ansible-core on the runner.

Run Ansible playbook

Executes:
```bash
ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False ansible-playbook \
  -i inventory -u ec2-user \
  --private-key ~/.ssh/deployer-key.pem site.yml
```

Disables host key checking (useful for fresh EC2), logs in as ec2-user, and configures the box (installs/starts httpd, etc.).

In one line:
Push to main ‚Üí Terraform builds EC2 ‚Üí IP gets dropped into ansible/inventory ‚Üí Ansible SSHs in and configures it. üöÄ

# üöÄ Launching the CI/CD Job

The beauty of this setup is that you don‚Äôt need to manually run Terraform or Ansible anymore ‚Äî GitHub Actions does it all for you.

Here‚Äôs how to launch the workflow from start to finish üëá

# üß© 1. Push Your Code to GitHub

The workflow is triggered every time you push to the main branch.
So all you have to do is:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "deploy new infrastructure"
git push origin main
```


Once you push, GitHub Actions automatically:

Spins up a fresh Ubuntu runner

Sets up Terraform

Builds your AWS EC2 instance

Generates the Ansible inventory file

SSHs into the new instance

Runs your Ansible playbook to install and configure httpd

No manual commands. No local dependencies. Just a clean, automated build pipeline every time.

# üîê 2. Very Important

Before you push for the first time, confirm your repo has the following secrets configured under
Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Repository secrets in Github:

Secret Name	Purpose
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID	AWS access key for Terraform
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY	AWS secret key for Terraform
SSH_PUBLIC_KEY	Public key that Terraform uploads to AWS
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY	Private key used by Ansible to SSH into EC2

These secrets allow your workflow to authenticate securely without ever exposing credentials in your code.

# üß† 3. Watch the Workflow Run

Go to your repo on GitHub.

Click the Actions tab at the top.

You‚Äôll see your workflow:
‚ÄúDeploy Infrastructure and Configure with Ansible‚Äù

Click it to view logs in real time ‚Äî you‚Äôll see Terraform apply, Ansible install packages, and httpd start up.

‚úÖ If everything succeeds, you‚Äôll have a brand-new EC2 instance running Apache, ready to serve web traffic!

# üèÅ Closing Thoughts

This project started as a simple idea ‚Äî ‚Äúuse Terraform to build, and Ansible to configure.‚Äù
But it quickly evolved into a full DevOps pipeline that ties together Infrastructure as Code, Configuration Management, and Continuous Deployment ‚Äî all running automatically through GitHub Actions.

Every failed attempt, error message, and retry became a valuable learning moment.
Now, the entire workflow ‚Äî from provisioning an EC2 instance to installing and testing a web server ‚Äî runs in one seamless push.

This project represents not just automation, but growth ‚Äî learning how to build smarter, fail forward, and make complex things simple.
